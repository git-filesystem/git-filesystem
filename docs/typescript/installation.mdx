The TypeScript library is broken out into a few different npm packages.

- [`git-filesystem`](https://npmjs.org/git-filesystem)
- [`@git-filesystem/abstractions`](https://npmjs.org/@git-filesystem/abstractions)
- [`@git-filesystem/github`](https://npmjs.org/@git-filesystem/github)
- [`@git-filesystem/gitlab`](https://npmjs.org/@git-filesystem/gitlab)

All of the packages are originally written in TypeScript but are compiled down to JavaScript and ship with their respective type files (`.d.ts` files).

If you only want to interact with one specific git provider, then you can install the specific package for that provider.

If you want to allow your users to pick the provider of their choice, then install the main package ([`git-filesystem`](https://npmjs.org/git-filesystem)).
This package uses the other packages under the hood and exposes a single API for all of them, meaning you don't need to write different code to handle different providers!

```bash npm2yarn
npm install git-filesystem
```
