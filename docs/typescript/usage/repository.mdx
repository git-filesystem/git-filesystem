## Files

When you have a repository from a [client](./client), you can read and write to the files within it.
The available methods include:

### `createFile()`

Creates a new commit that creates a new file in the repository.

```ts
await repository.createFile("path/to/file.txt", "file content");
```

#### Throws:

- `CommitError`: If there's an unknown error while committing.

<hr />

### `readFile()`

Reads a files content from the remote repository.

```ts
const fileContent = await repository.readFile("path/to/file.txt");
```

#### Throws:

- `FileNotFoundError`: If the file does not exist.

<hr />

### `updateFile()`

Creates a new commit that replaces the content of a file in the repository.

```ts
await repository.updateFile("path/to/file.txt", "file content");
```

:::tip

The `updateFile` method requires you to pass in the whole file content, just like a traditional file-system API.
You cannot pass in a diff/patch/delta like you would with a Git API.

#### Throws:

- `CommitError`: If there's an unknown error while committing.

<hr />

### `deleteFile()`

Creates a new commit that deletes a file from the repository.

```ts
await repository.deleteFile("path/to/file.txt");
```

#### Throws:

- `CommitError`: If there's an unknown error while committing.

<hr />

### JSON Helper Methods

The create, read, and update methods also come with JSON helper-method equivalents:

```ts
await repository.createJsonFile("path/to/file.json", anyObject);
```

```ts
const anyObject = await repository.readJsonFile<ObjectType>("path/to/file.json");
```

```ts
await repository.updateJsonFile("path/to/file.json", anyObject);
```

<hr />

## Tags

The repository class also exposes methods for handling tags.
You can create tags at the current `HEAD` of the repository's branch and then read files back from that tag at a later point in time.

```ts
await repository.createFile("path/to/file.txt", "original content");

await repository.createTag("myTag");

await repository.updateFile("path/to/file.txt", "new content");

await repository.readFile("path/to/file.txt"); // returns "new content"
await repository.readFile("path/to/file.txt", "myTag"); // returns "original content"
```

<hr />

## `createCommitBuilder()`

Sometimes you might want to apply changes to multiple files using a single commit.
To achive this, call the `createCommitBuilder()` method to get a new [`CommitBuilder`](./commitBuilder).
See the [`CommitBuilder`](./commitBuilder) page for details on how to use it.

```ts
const commitBuilder = repository.createCommitBuilder();
```
