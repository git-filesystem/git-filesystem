Use a `CommitBuilder` to apply multiple changes to different files using a single commit.

The `CommitBuilder` exposes methods that are very similar to the [`Repository`](./repository), with the main difference being that they're mostly synchronous.

A given file path can only have one type of action (create/update/delete) applied to it per `CommitBuilder`.

### `createFile()`

Adds a pending creation of a file to be committed later.

```ts
commitBuilder.createFile(path: string, content: string): void;
```

#### Throws:

- `AlreadyCommittedError`: If `createCommit()` has already been called.
- `MultipleFileActionsError`: If the given file path is already set to be created, updated, or deleted.

<hr />

### `updateFile()`

Adds a pending change to a file to be committed later.

```ts
commitBuilder.updateFile(path: string, content: string): void;
```

#### Throws:

- `AlreadyCommittedError`: If `createCommit()` has already been called.
- `MultipleFileActionsError`: If the given file path is already set to be created, updated, or deleted.

<hr />

### `readFile()`

Reads the content of a file.

If the file **does** a pending creation or update on the current `CommitBuilder` then the file content will be read directly from the `CommitBuilder`.

If the file will **not** be created or updated using the current `CommitBuilder` then the file content will be read from the remote repository.

```ts
commitBuilder.readFile(path: string): Promise<string>;
commitBuilder.readFile(path: string, tagName: string): Promise<string>;
```

#### Throws:

- `AlreadyCommittedError`: If `createCommit()` has already been called.
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the file does not exist.

<hr />

### `deleteFile()`

Adds a pending deletion of a file to be committed later.

```ts
commitBuilder.deleteFile(path: string): void;
```

#### Throws:

- `AlreadyCommittedError`: If `createCommit()` has already been called.
- `MultipleFileActionsError`: If the given file path is already set to be created, updated, or deleted.

<hr />

### `createCommit()`

Applies the configured changes in a single commit to the remote repository.

Once `createCommit` has been called, the `CommitBuilder` should not be used any further.

```ts
commitBuilder.createCommit(commitMessage: string): Promise<string>;
```

#### Throws:

- `AlreadyCommittedError`: If `createCommit()` has already been called.
- `EmptyCommitError`: If you call `createCommit()` without creating, updating, or deleting a file.
- `CommitError`: If there's an unknown error while committing.

<hr />

### JSON Helper Methods

Just like on the [`Repository`](./repository), the create, read, and update methods also come with JSON helper-method equivalents:

```ts
await commitBuilder.createJsonFile("path/to/file.json", anyObject);
```

```ts
const anyObject = await commitBuilder.readJsonFile<ObjectType>("path/to/file.json");
```

```ts
await commitBuilder.updateJsonFile("path/to/file.json", anyObject);
```
